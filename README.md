# Bug Tracker Application 


### What is a ***Bug Tracker***?
This is a bug tracking desktop application that lets users add bugs and errors 
they have encountered in order to keep track of all bugs and information related 
to them all in one place. This application enables developers to log the issues 
they have found along with the severity level, details about the issue, 
the assignee for the issue, and progress made to resolve the issue.
This application also enables developers to keep track of repetitive 
issues and view a history of all previous bugs.

### Who will use a **Bug Tracker**?
This application is directed towards developers who are looking to improve 
their project by keeping track of all the bugs and issues along with 
descriptions of them. Developers are able to organize, prioritize and track 
these issues until they are resolved. 

### Why is this project of interest to me?
As a developer I appreciate software solutions that aim to assist my fellow 
software developers for the purpose of efficiency and productivity in daily 
projects. Streamlining the debugging process of alpha and beta releases of 
software. I intend to create a space for collecting all bugs and issues to 
make it easier for developers to fix the issues. Additionally, this project 
can contribute to my future idea of creating a larger scale
social network for users of this profession.
